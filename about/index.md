<h2><center>About Me!</center></h2>

<center>A visual effects artist living in London, originally from Finland. Currently I'm working at MPC London. All aspects of graphics interest me, however I dospecialize in effects. I am experienced in wide range of CG tools such as Houdini, Maya, 3ds Max, ZBrush, Nuke and Photoshop.

Outside of graphics I enjoy wide variety of music, traveling, architecture, cooking and reading.</center>
